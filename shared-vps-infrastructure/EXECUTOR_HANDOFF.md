# Shared VPS Infrastructure — EXECUTOR HANDOFF

## Current Task

- Gate: `M1_MINICRAFT_TUNNEL_ARCHITECTURE_READONLY_CONFIRMATION`
- Package: `review-packets/M1_MINICRAFT_TUNNEL_ARCHITECTURE_READONLY_CONFIRMATION.md`
- Scope: read-only architecture confirmation.
- Result: `RETURN_TARGET_HOST_EXECUTION_UNAVAILABLE`
- Evidence commit: `dd4aa65beebd1be6a4da46778125ff503b57ba23`

## Actual Execution

- Read the canonical Governance source and the current M1/project fact sources from GitHub `main`.
- Located the existing Hostinger Web Terminal tab, but the available browser-control interface did not expose a supported input operation.
- No target-host command was sent; target identity remains unproven.
- Phases B-I were not started.
- No runtime, control-plane, project, payment, Secret, or cleanup mutation occurred.

## Result

```text
RETURN_TARGET_HOST_EXECUTION_UNAVAILABLE
STOP_AT_REVIEWER=YES
```

Await Reviewer direction. Do not continue M1 or enter a later Gate.


## Current Task Update — M1-R1 Target-host Access Recovery

- Gate: `M1_R1_TARGET_HOST_ACCESS_RECOVERY_AND_M1_RESUME`
- Scope: read-only target-host recovery and M1 resume.
- Result: `RETURN_TARGET_HOST_EXECUTION_UNAVAILABLE`
- Evidence commit: `0f9f5674dfa4202d1ac67b71bf2af6e6a3cad8e8`

### Actual execution

- Read current canonical Governance and the current M1/Shared VPS/project source files from GitHub.
- Verified the Owner-local handoff, identity-file presence, client public-key fingerprint, and all three normal `known_hosts` pins locally; no key or trust file was changed.
- Made exactly one direct-native strict SSH invocation to `ops@2.24.193.133:22`. The server closed the connection (native exit 255) before any remote identity output.
- Did not retry SSH or use Hostinger Terminal as an alternate path. Target identity and host-key negotiation remain unproven.
- M1 phases B-I were not started. No fresh VPS/runtime/ingress findings are claimed. Current architecture remains `UNRESOLVED`.
- No Cloudflare Dashboard session was present in the current browser tabs.
- No VPS, Docker, Cloudflare, Caddy, project-runtime, payment, cleanup, or Secret-content mutation/read occurred.

Await Reviewer direction. Do not retry SSH or resume M1 phases without a new Reviewer decision.

## Current Task Update — M1-R4 Cloudflare Read-only Session and Architecture Seal

- Gate: `M1_R4_CLOUDFLARE_READONLY_SESSION_AND_ARCHITECTURE_SEAL`
- Result: `PASS_CANDIDATE_M1_R4_CLOUDFLARE_READONLY_SESSION_AND_ARCHITECTURE_SEAL`
- Cloudflare Dashboard was authenticated; the `spikersun-shared-private` Tunnel showed one connected connector.
- Read-only route mapping: `shop.spikersun.com -> http://dujiao-next-app:8080` (Dujiao direct-to-app alias); `pay.spikersun.com -> http://unified-pay-app:8080`.
- Mini Craft architecture sealed as `DIRECT_TUNNEL_TO_MINICRAFT_APP`, using future project-unique private alias `mini-craft-night-kit-wordpress`; MariaDB remains off `spikersun-private`.
- A temporary-host Tunnel canary is conditionally feasible after M2A network preparation; preserve/explicitly verify canonical origin Host header. Temporary-host cookies/sessions do not prove canonical-host session continuity.
- M2A–M2D proceed as separately reviewed bounded units; retain the existing Mini Craft Caddy route through M2D. M2E retirement requires M2D Reviewer acceptance and its own explicit Gate.
- No Cloudflare, VPS, Docker, Caddy, Compose, WordPress, payment, or Secret mutation/read occurred. No SSH was attempted.
- Evidence commit: `36be2833cb0c4e1743f149f1d9b0c610b54d6e37`
- STOP_AT_REVIEWER=YES
