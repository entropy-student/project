## SYSTEM_MAP

- CMS/storefront: WordPress 7.1.1 + Blocksy 2.1.57 + Gutenberg.
- Commerce/order: WooCommerce 11.1.2, canonical.
- Current local G3C runtime: project-isolated Docker/MariaDB/Mailpit; retained for Owner/Reviewer frontend review.
- Current local site: `http://127.0.0.1:8189/`.
- Current wp-admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8189/wp-admin/`.
- Product: Woo product 1113, virtual, USD 39.99.
- Free Preview: project-local frontend component; selected photo remains browser-local; no server photo upload and no model request.
- Account/private workspace: authenticated account + Woo order ownership.
- Payment baseline: official WooCommerce PayPal Payments; Sandbox proof accepted. Live/real-money not proven.
- Paid generation: exact production provider/runtime remains UNKNOWN.
- Production deployment/storage/private final delivery: UNKNOWN / not yet proven.
- Shared VPS dependency: NONE accepted for current Gate.

## CURRENT_ACCEPTED_STATE

- G2BR3: real-AI structured content + deterministic 12-page PDF Solution Proof PASS.
- G3A: WordPress/WooCommerce commerce/account/private-workspace loop PASS.
- G3B/G3BR1: bounded PayPal Sandbox capture/entitlement/refund/revocation/cleanup PASS.
- G3CR2R3: Blocksy Wedding Gutenberg + Woo compatibility PASS.
- G3CR4/G3CR5: earlier frontend regressions PASS at their tested scope.
- G3CR6: RETURN because the visual direction was underexecuted.
- G3CR6R1: PASS; Warm Birthday Gift composition, Preview privacy, native Woo path, 375px behavior, and Owner editability accepted.
- G3CR6R3D1: RETURN only on fresh local-runtime readback; Focusly public desktop/375/motion evidence and 66 screenshots preserved as reusable evidence.
- G3CR6R3D1R2: PASS; fresh Home 858/runtime/theme/menu/CTA/Preview and read-only Woo route baseline closed at Executor commit `7a0a16cf0169980443f8bb760f7f9e919ff0d68c`.
- G3CR6R3D2: technical acceptance PASS; D2R1 direct visual review identified bounded quality gaps.
- G3CR6R3D2R2: PASS; Owner-uploaded R2 contact sheet was directly inspected. Samples/Selected Work, image diversity, mobile header and mobile rhythm now meet the Reviewer quality bar while accepted Hero/editorial panel/closing/Preview/Woo behavior remains preserved.
- Owner Visual Checkpoint R2: resolved; Owner broadly accepts the overall composition but now explicitly rates the homepage around 7/10 for the intended quality bar, wants meaningful motion, wants the actual final magazine shown clearly, and rates the current upload-first Preview around 5/10.
- Owner editability at G3CR6R1 evidence scope: Administrator, edit Home, replace media, edit copy, reorder eight major Gutenberg Groups, edit Blocksy global style/palette; footer is editable WordPress block.
- PR #64 remains open/unmerged; latest accepted D1R2 evidence commit is `7a0a16cf0169980443f8bb760f7f9e919ff0d68c`. Project-scoped freshness, not whole-monorepo tip ancestry, controls execution.
- Fresh 2026-10-04 source-baseline closure: reconciliation anchor `83a8ad33ed70e2a391e4a4dacd71e0b812b15ef6` proved the bounded merge strategy and preserved the prior 7 G3C/G3CR6R1 branch commits/evidence. A later Executor correctly returned when unrelated `vpn-network-optimization/` commits moved repository `main`; Reviewer confirmed this was **not Birthday Magazine project drift** and corrected the preflight to project-scoped freshness. The approved PR #64 execution head must descend from the anchor and contain all current-main changes affecting `birthday-magazine-studio/**` or another path explicitly named by the Gate; unrelated monorepo commits do not block.

## CURRENT_GATE

`G3CR6R3D2R4_MOTION_POLISH`

Owner-browser diagnosis is complete.

Direct Owner readback proves:
- `reducedMotion=false`;
- `home-motion.js` is loaded;
- `bms-motion-on` is active;
- Samples card motion variables are being written (`-8deg`, `0.9`, matrix3d);
- therefore the failure class is **MOTION_RUNNING_BUT_NOT_PERCEPTIBLE**.

Preserved:
- D2R2 static visual quality PASS;
- all five R2 marketing assets;
- current homepage composition/copy;
- Preview/Woo/account/payment/private-workspace freeze.

Current repair objective:
- strengthen homepage motion so it is visibly perceptible in the Owner's normal browser without DevTools;
- specifically improve Hero living focus, editorial image choreography, photo-panel parallax, Samples scroll progression, and desktop Closing sticky reveal;
- preserve reduced-motion/no-JS accessibility fallbacks.

Current Gate:
- `docs/G3CR6R3D2R4_MOTION_POLISH.md`

Diagnostic decision:
- `docs/REVIEWER_DECISION_G3CR6R3D2R3_PASS_MOTION_DIAGNOSTIC.md`

Mandatory stop:
- Executor produces motion-polished local candidate + multi-state evidence;
- Owner then performs live-browser motion check;
- no PR merge, production deploy, Preview redesign, payment action, P1-P12 or core-Aha work.

## CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS

```text
FREE_PREVIEW_MODEL_CALLS=0
FREE_PREVIEW_SERVER_PHOTO_UPLOADS=0
FREE_PREVIEW_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_POSTS=0
WOO_COMMERCE_CANONICAL_ORDER_SYSTEM=YES
AUTHENTICATED_ACCOUNT_MVP=YES
GUEST_BEARER_PRIVATE_DELIVERY=NO
REAL_MONEY_ACTIONS=0
PAYPAL_ACTIONS_CURRENT_GATE=0
CHECKOUT_SUBMISSIONS_CURRENT_GATE=0
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT=0
SHARED_INFRA_MUTATIONS=0
PR_64_MERGE=0
G4_ACTIONS=0
```

Protected backend behavior for the current visual/research phase:
- Woo cart/order/checkout business logic;
- payment gateway;
- order state;
- account authorization;
- private-workspace ownership guard;
- entitlement/generation-job semantics;
- database schema;
- production provider.

## DEFAULT_EXECUTION_CHANNEL

- Canonical research/Gate authority is current GitHub `main`.
- Existing PR #64 branch is the **approved G3CR6R3C execution baseline** after source reconciliation; Executor should use the current branch head and current Gate/relay, not reconstruct project history.
- Freshness is **project-scoped**: current-main-only changes under `birthday-magazine-studio/**` (or another path explicitly named by this Gate) block execution; unrelated commits elsewhere in the shared monorepo do not.
- Research writes remain project-scoped to `birthday-magazine-studio/`; the 7 historical G3C/G3CR6R1 branch commits/evidence remain preserved.
- No new PR by default. No production/target-host execution in G3CR6R3C.

## CURRENT_ROLLBACK_STATUS

- Accepted rollback target: G3CR6R1 state.
- Prior G3CR6/G3CR6R1 rollback evidence must not be overwritten.
- G3CR6R2 is superseded before execution.
- G3CR6R3 must create its own scoped rollback point before mutation.
- Git history remains the source-code recovery baseline.
- PR #64 branch-only G3C/G3CR6R1 evidence is a preservation requirement during source-baseline repair; do not reset/drop it merely to match `main`.

## UNRESOLVED

- exact buyer segment within the broader US birthday-gift market;
- durable archive of Owner-reported Problem Evidence/VOC;
- real US customer payment at USD 39.99;
- repeatable acquisition;
- CAC/contribution economics;
- real per-order production AI/render/storage cost;
- unattended production provider/runtime and provider-spend idempotency;
- production storage/private delivery/recovery;
- production refund/cancellation policy;
- final visual freeze after template selection and the subsequent bounded implementation/review;
- final visual freeze after template research/selection remains pending; source/branch packaging for G3CR6R3C is resolved.

## NEXT_STEP

1. Execute **G3CR6R3D2R4** as a presentation-only motion polish.
2. Make the accepted static homepage visibly dynamic in ordinary browsing, using the already-observed Focusly motion behaviors as reference.
3. Preserve reduced-motion/no-JS static completeness and all protected Preview/Woo behavior.
4. After Executor PASS_CANDIDATE, Owner opens the local site and verifies four motion classes: Hero, editorial/photo sections, Samples, Closing.
5. Only after Owner confirms perceptible motion may the homepage visual freeze resume.

## OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED

**NONE now.** The diagnostic is complete.

After D2R4 Executor returns PASS_CANDIDATE, Owner will only need to open `http://127.0.0.1:8189/` and confirm the strengthened motion is visibly perceptible.

## EVIDENCE_POINTERS

Current working set:
1. `docs/G3CR6R3D2R4_MOTION_POLISH.md`
2. `docs/REVIEWER_DECISION_G3CR6R3D2R3_PASS_MOTION_DIAGNOSTIC.md`
3. current `poc/g3c/preview-plugin/home-motion.js`
4. current `poc/g3c/preview-plugin/home.css`
5. `docs/G3CR6R3D1_FOCUSLY_VISUAL_MAPPING_REPORT.md` section 3 motion inventory
6. accepted D2R2 QA/rollback/source-correlation evidence
7. `EXECUTION_EVIDENCE.md` and `EXECUTOR_HANDOFF.md`

Static R2 design remains accepted. Only perceptible motion is open.
