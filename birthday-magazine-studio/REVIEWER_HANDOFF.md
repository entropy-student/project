## SYSTEM_MAP

- CMS/storefront: WordPress 7.1.1 + Blocksy 2.1.57 + Gutenberg.
- Commerce/order: WooCommerce 11.1.2, canonical.
- Current local G3C runtime: project-isolated Docker/MariaDB/Mailpit; retained for Owner/Reviewer frontend review.
- Current local site: `http://127.0.0.1:8189/`.
- Current wp-admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8189/wp-admin/`.
- Product: Woo product 1113, virtual, USD 39.99.
- Free Preview: project-local frontend component; selected photo remains browser-local; no server photo upload and no model request.
- Account/private workspace: authenticated account + Woo order ownership.
- Payment baseline: official WooCommerce PayPal Payments; Sandbox proof accepted. Live/real-money not proven.
- Paid generation: exact production provider/runtime remains UNKNOWN.
- Production deployment/storage/private final delivery: UNKNOWN / not yet proven.
- Shared VPS dependency: NONE accepted for current Gate.

## CURRENT_ACCEPTED_STATE

- G2BR3: real-AI structured content + deterministic 12-page PDF Solution Proof PASS.
- G3A: WordPress/WooCommerce commerce/account/private-workspace loop PASS.
- G3B/G3BR1: bounded PayPal Sandbox capture/entitlement/refund/revocation/cleanup PASS.
- G3CR2R3: Blocksy Wedding Gutenberg + Woo compatibility PASS.
- G3CR4/G3CR5: earlier frontend regressions PASS at their tested scope.
- G3CR6: RETURN because the visual direction was underexecuted.
- G3CR6R1: PASS; Warm Birthday Gift composition, Preview privacy, native Woo path, 375px behavior, and Owner editability accepted.
- G3CR6R3D1: RETURN only on fresh local-runtime readback; Focusly public desktop/375/motion evidence and 66 screenshots preserved as reusable evidence.
- G3CR6R3D1R2: PASS; fresh Home 858/runtime/theme/menu/CTA/Preview and read-only Woo route baseline closed at Executor commit `7a0a16cf0169980443f8bb760f7f9e919ff0d68c`.
- Owner Visual Checkpoint R2: resolved; Owner broadly accepts the overall composition but now explicitly rates the homepage around 7/10 for the intended quality bar, wants meaningful motion, wants the actual final magazine shown clearly, and rates the current upload-first Preview around 5/10.
- Owner editability at G3CR6R1 evidence scope: Administrator, edit Home, replace media, edit copy, reorder eight major Gutenberg Groups, edit Blocksy global style/palette; footer is editable WordPress block.
- PR #64 remains open/unmerged; latest accepted D1R2 evidence commit is `7a0a16cf0169980443f8bb760f7f9e919ff0d68c`. Project-scoped freshness, not whole-monorepo tip ancestry, controls execution.
- Fresh 2026-10-04 source-baseline closure: reconciliation anchor `83a8ad33ed70e2a391e4a4dacd71e0b812b15ef6` proved the bounded merge strategy and preserved the prior 7 G3C/G3CR6R1 branch commits/evidence. A later Executor correctly returned when unrelated `vpn-network-optimization/` commits moved repository `main`; Reviewer confirmed this was **not Birthday Magazine project drift** and corrected the preflight to project-scoped freshness. The approved PR #64 execution head must descend from the anchor and contain all current-main changes affecting `birthday-magazine-studio/**` or another path explicitly named by the Gate; unrelated monorepo commits do not block.

## CURRENT_GATE

`G3CR6R3D2_FOCUSLY_HOMEPAGE_IMPLEMENTATION`

Objective:
- independently implement a high-fidelity Focusly-inspired Birthday Magazine homepage from the already accepted public-reference mapping;
- preserve the current upload/Preview interaction exactly at the functional/component level;
- preserve WooCommerce/Product/Cart/Checkout/Account/payment/private-workspace semantics;
- produce a desktop + 375px + motion + reduced-motion/no-JS evidence package for Owner visual review.

Scope:
- Home 858 Gutenberg presentation;
- homepage-scoped CSS;
- optional homepage-only motion controller;
- narrowly guarded homepage enqueue;
- exact mobile menu anchor correction `/#sample-pages -> /#samples`;
- conditional Footer Privacy-link wiring only if an already-published intended WordPress privacy page is positively identified.

Not reopened:
- Preview interaction design;
- Preview JS/shortcode internals;
- P1-P12 magazine visual system;
- unresolved core Aha interaction;
- Woo/account/payment/order/private-workspace business logic;
- production deployment.

Visual target:
- materially close to the public Focusly Home 1 composition and motion language, independently implemented with Birthday Magazine content and owned/rights-compatible assets;
- no copying/extraction of paid template source or proprietary assets.

Current Gate file:
- `docs/G3CR6R3D2_FOCUSLY_HOMEPAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Current Reviewer decision:
- `docs/REVIEWER_DECISION_G3CR6R3D1R2_PASS.md`

Latest Owner Preview decision:
- `docs/OWNER_DECISION_G3CR6R3D_PREVIEW_INTERACTION_HOLD_2026-10-04.md`

Mandatory stop:
- implementation + evidence only, then STOP_AT_REVIEWER;
- PR #64 remains unmerged;
- formal visual acceptance still requires Owner review.

## CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS

```text
FREE_PREVIEW_MODEL_CALLS=0
FREE_PREVIEW_SERVER_PHOTO_UPLOADS=0
FREE_PREVIEW_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_POSTS=0
WOO_COMMERCE_CANONICAL_ORDER_SYSTEM=YES
AUTHENTICATED_ACCOUNT_MVP=YES
GUEST_BEARER_PRIVATE_DELIVERY=NO
REAL_MONEY_ACTIONS=0
PAYPAL_ACTIONS_CURRENT_GATE=0
CHECKOUT_SUBMISSIONS_CURRENT_GATE=0
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT=0
SHARED_INFRA_MUTATIONS=0
PR_64_MERGE=0
G4_ACTIONS=0
```

Protected backend behavior for the current visual/research phase:
- Woo cart/order/checkout business logic;
- payment gateway;
- order state;
- account authorization;
- private-workspace ownership guard;
- entitlement/generation-job semantics;
- database schema;
- production provider.

## DEFAULT_EXECUTION_CHANNEL

- Canonical research/Gate authority is current GitHub `main`.
- Existing PR #64 branch is the **approved G3CR6R3C execution baseline** after source reconciliation; Executor should use the current branch head and current Gate/relay, not reconstruct project history.
- Freshness is **project-scoped**: current-main-only changes under `birthday-magazine-studio/**` (or another path explicitly named by this Gate) block execution; unrelated commits elsewhere in the shared monorepo do not.
- Research writes remain project-scoped to `birthday-magazine-studio/`; the 7 historical G3C/G3CR6R1 branch commits/evidence remain preserved.
- No new PR by default. No production/target-host execution in G3CR6R3C.

## CURRENT_ROLLBACK_STATUS

- Accepted rollback target: G3CR6R1 state.
- Prior G3CR6/G3CR6R1 rollback evidence must not be overwritten.
- G3CR6R2 is superseded before execution.
- G3CR6R3 must create its own scoped rollback point before mutation.
- Git history remains the source-code recovery baseline.
- PR #64 branch-only G3C/G3CR6R1 evidence is a preservation requirement during source-baseline repair; do not reset/drop it merely to match `main`.

## UNRESOLVED

- exact buyer segment within the broader US birthday-gift market;
- durable archive of Owner-reported Problem Evidence/VOC;
- real US customer payment at USD 39.99;
- repeatable acquisition;
- CAC/contribution economics;
- real per-order production AI/render/storage cost;
- unattended production provider/runtime and provider-spend idempotency;
- production storage/private delivery/recovery;
- production refund/cancellation policy;
- final visual freeze after template selection and the subsequent bounded implementation/review;
- final visual freeze after template research/selection remains pending; source/branch packaging for G3CR6R3C is resolved.

## NEXT_STEP

1. Execute **G3CR6R3D2** on PR #64 from the accepted D1R2 baseline.
2. Implement the Focusly-inspired homepage at high visual/motion fidelity while keeping the current upload/Preview component unchanged.
3. Fix only the known mobile samples anchor; leave the empty Footer Privacy link untouched unless a valid existing published privacy page is positively identified.
4. Capture desktop 1440px + mobile 375px + motion + reduced-motion/no-JS + read-only Woo route evidence.
5. Stop at Reviewer. Reviewer then decides whether the candidate is ready for Owner visual confirmation.

## OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED

`NONE` for D2 execution.

Owner action is required after Reviewer accepts the implementation evidence for:
- subjective homepage visual freeze / requested visual changes;
- any future decision to reopen/change the upload/Preview interaction;
- any real payment/Live provider action;
- account/Secret/provider authorization;
- production enablement.
