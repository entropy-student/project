## SYSTEM_MAP

- CMS/storefront: WordPress 7.1.1 + Blocksy 2.1.57 + Gutenberg.
- Commerce/order: WooCommerce 11.1.2, canonical.
- Current local G3C runtime: project-isolated Docker/MariaDB/Mailpit; retained for Owner/Reviewer frontend review.
- Current local site: `http://127.0.0.1:8189/`.
- Current wp-admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8189/wp-admin/`.
- Product: Woo product 1113, virtual, USD 39.99.
- Free Preview: project-local frontend component; selected photo remains browser-local; no server photo upload and no model request.
- Account/private workspace: authenticated account + Woo order ownership.
- Payment baseline: official WooCommerce PayPal Payments; Sandbox proof accepted. Live/real-money not proven.
- Paid generation: exact production provider/runtime remains UNKNOWN.
- Production deployment/storage/private final delivery: UNKNOWN / not yet proven.
- Shared VPS dependency: NONE accepted for current Gate.

## CURRENT_ACCEPTED_STATE

- G2BR3: real-AI structured content + deterministic 12-page PDF Solution Proof PASS.
- G3A: WordPress/WooCommerce commerce/account/private-workspace loop PASS.
- G3B/G3BR1: bounded PayPal Sandbox capture/entitlement/refund/revocation/cleanup PASS.
- G3CR2R3: Blocksy Wedding Gutenberg + Woo compatibility PASS.
- G3CR4/G3CR5: earlier frontend regressions PASS at their tested scope.
- G3CR6: RETURN because the visual direction was underexecuted.
- G3CR6R1: PASS; Warm Birthday Gift composition, Preview privacy, native Woo path, 375px behavior, and Owner editability accepted.
- G3CR6R3D1: RETURN only on fresh local-runtime readback; Focusly public desktop/375/motion evidence and 66 screenshots preserved as reusable evidence.
- G3CR6R3D1R2: PASS; fresh Home 858/runtime/theme/menu/CTA/Preview and read-only Woo route baseline closed at Executor commit `7a0a16cf0169980443f8bb760f7f9e919ff0d68c`.
- G3CR6R3D2: technical acceptance PASS; D2R1 direct visual review identified bounded quality gaps.
- G3CR6R3D2R2: PASS; Owner-uploaded R2 contact sheet was directly inspected. Samples/Selected Work, image diversity, mobile header and mobile rhythm now meet the Reviewer quality bar while accepted Hero/editorial panel/closing/Preview/Woo behavior remains preserved.
- Owner Visual Checkpoint R2: resolved; Owner broadly accepts the overall composition but now explicitly rates the homepage around 7/10 for the intended quality bar, wants meaningful motion, wants the actual final magazine shown clearly, and rates the current upload-first Preview around 5/10.
- Owner editability at G3CR6R1 evidence scope: Administrator, edit Home, replace media, edit copy, reorder eight major Gutenberg Groups, edit Blocksy global style/palette; footer is editable WordPress block.
- PR #64 remains open/unmerged; latest accepted D1R2 evidence commit is `7a0a16cf0169980443f8bb760f7f9e919ff0d68c`. Project-scoped freshness, not whole-monorepo tip ancestry, controls execution.
- Fresh 2026-10-04 source-baseline closure: reconciliation anchor `83a8ad33ed70e2a391e4a4dacd71e0b812b15ef6` proved the bounded merge strategy and preserved the prior 7 G3C/G3CR6R1 branch commits/evidence. A later Executor correctly returned when unrelated `vpn-network-optimization/` commits moved repository `main`; Reviewer confirmed this was **not Birthday Magazine project drift** and corrected the preflight to project-scoped freshness. The approved PR #64 execution head must descend from the anchor and contain all current-main changes affecting `birthday-magazine-studio/**` or another path explicitly named by the Gate; unrelated monorepo commits do not block.

## CURRENT_GATE

`OWNER_HOMEPAGE_VISUAL_CONFIRMATION`

Reviewer has formally PASSed `G3CR6R3D2R2_VISUAL_POLISH` on candidate `8d03464dbf1678468a289e4676ba975745bcb94d`.

Accepted:
- Focusly-inspired homepage technical implementation;
- desktop 1440 + mobile 375 visual quality;
- large editorial Samples / Selected Work;
- materially diverse major-section imagery;
- mobile header and page rhythm;
- motion, reduced-motion and no-JS fallback;
- current upload/Preview KEEP-AS-IS boundary;
- Woo/account/payment/private-workspace freeze;
- R2 rollback to accepted D2;
- five generated static marketing assets with provenance.

Current checkpoint:
- Owner decides whether the current homepage visual direction is acceptable for this stage.

No implementation or merge is authorized by this checkpoint.

Current Reviewer decision:
- `docs/REVIEWER_DECISION_G3CR6R3D2R2_PASS.md`

Current Owner checkpoint:
- `docs/OWNER_CHECKPOINT_G3CR6R3D2_HOMEPAGE_VISUAL_CONFIRMATION.md`

Still unresolved and separate:
- core Aha interaction;
- P1-P12 magazine visual system;
- Privacy Policy publication;
- PR #64 merge;
- production deployment;
- real-money/Live payment.

## CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS

```text
FREE_PREVIEW_MODEL_CALLS=0
FREE_PREVIEW_SERVER_PHOTO_UPLOADS=0
FREE_PREVIEW_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_POSTS=0
WOO_COMMERCE_CANONICAL_ORDER_SYSTEM=YES
AUTHENTICATED_ACCOUNT_MVP=YES
GUEST_BEARER_PRIVATE_DELIVERY=NO
REAL_MONEY_ACTIONS=0
PAYPAL_ACTIONS_CURRENT_GATE=0
CHECKOUT_SUBMISSIONS_CURRENT_GATE=0
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT=0
SHARED_INFRA_MUTATIONS=0
PR_64_MERGE=0
G4_ACTIONS=0
```

Protected backend behavior for the current visual/research phase:
- Woo cart/order/checkout business logic;
- payment gateway;
- order state;
- account authorization;
- private-workspace ownership guard;
- entitlement/generation-job semantics;
- database schema;
- production provider.

## DEFAULT_EXECUTION_CHANNEL

- Canonical research/Gate authority is current GitHub `main`.
- Existing PR #64 branch is the **approved G3CR6R3C execution baseline** after source reconciliation; Executor should use the current branch head and current Gate/relay, not reconstruct project history.
- Freshness is **project-scoped**: current-main-only changes under `birthday-magazine-studio/**` (or another path explicitly named by this Gate) block execution; unrelated commits elsewhere in the shared monorepo do not.
- Research writes remain project-scoped to `birthday-magazine-studio/`; the 7 historical G3C/G3CR6R1 branch commits/evidence remain preserved.
- No new PR by default. No production/target-host execution in G3CR6R3C.

## CURRENT_ROLLBACK_STATUS

- Accepted rollback target: G3CR6R1 state.
- Prior G3CR6/G3CR6R1 rollback evidence must not be overwritten.
- G3CR6R2 is superseded before execution.
- G3CR6R3 must create its own scoped rollback point before mutation.
- Git history remains the source-code recovery baseline.
- PR #64 branch-only G3C/G3CR6R1 evidence is a preservation requirement during source-baseline repair; do not reset/drop it merely to match `main`.

## UNRESOLVED

- exact buyer segment within the broader US birthday-gift market;
- durable archive of Owner-reported Problem Evidence/VOC;
- real US customer payment at USD 39.99;
- repeatable acquisition;
- CAC/contribution economics;
- real per-order production AI/render/storage cost;
- unattended production provider/runtime and provider-spend idempotency;
- production storage/private delivery/recovery;
- production refund/cancellation policy;
- final visual freeze after template selection and the subsequent bounded implementation/review;
- final visual freeze after template research/selection remains pending; source/branch packaging for G3CR6R3C is resolved.

## NEXT_STEP

1. Owner reviews the current R2 homepage and chooses **accept for this stage** or requests specific visual changes.
2. If accepted, Reviewer records `OWNER_HOMEPAGE_VISUAL_FREEZE=PASS`.
3. After that confirmation, resume the still-unresolved visual/product work outside the homepage; current upload/Preview interaction remains on hold unless Owner explicitly reopens it.
4. PR #64 remains unmerged until a later reviewed integration/merge Gate.

## OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED

Choose one:

1. **Accept current homepage visual direction for this stage**, or
2. state the specific homepage visual changes still wanted.

No other Owner action is required now.
