Current known components:
- VPS: DigitalOcean `sfo3`, public IP `24.199.118.137`.
- WireGuard: active MTU 1420; current IPv4 defaults are two `/1` routes, not `0.0.0.0/0`.
- WireGuard Windows strict WFP kill-switch: absent after the accepted G2-B repair.
- Hysteria2: official v2.12.3, independent service on UDP 8443.
- Windows client: Clash Verge 2.5.6; accepted current Mihomo core v1.19.32. Historical G2-C proofs used v1.19.31.
- Owner execution runtime: PowerShell 7.6.6, Administrator, High integrity.
- HY2 recovery: canonical DPAPI CurrentUser recovery artifact validated; do not re-fetch or rotate VPS Secrets.

## CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS

- Production WireGuard must remain available throughout C2B.
- C2B is synthetic/UI-only: no real HY2 credential, endpoint, traffic, DPAPI recovery read, VPS access, REALITY activation, or route/proxy/TUN/WireGuard mutation.
- Owner-local actions must use the reviewed one-shot runner; Owner is not responsible for debugging or redesign.
- Any canonical Gate/relay disagreement fails closed before Owner-local execution.

## DEFAULT_EXECUTION_CHANNEL

`CODEX_DESKTOP -> reviewed Owner-local PowerShell one-shot checkpoint when explicitly requested by the current Gate`.

## CURRENT_ROLLBACK_STATUS

No production mutation is authorized in C2B. Current rollback/continuity baseline is the already-running WireGuard path. The synthetic profile must be removed during the checkpoint; the runner may clean only its own exact temporary runtime files.

## UNRESOLVED

- C2B synthetic Clash UI visibility/manual-selector proof has not yet run.
- C2C real HY2-in-Clash proof remains pending.
- REALITY remains cold/deferred for persistent manual-control use.

## CURRENT_ACCEPTED_STATE

- **Current production:** WireGuard remains connected and authoritative.
- **G3-C C1:** PASS; Windows Mihomo v1.19.32 accepted.
- **G3-C C2A repair:** accepted technically with the previously recorded timing-observability gap.
- **G3-C C2B-P0 R1 durability objective:** accepted without replay. Canonical commits `fc2aa9399627c19b5368ed6da6a219deaeb20b77` and `dd8651aa760062f71ddc84a1154b21873ecbc174` durably contain the previously missing GitHub read-back, Git-persistence timing, and safe-fast-forward facts.
- **R1 formal Gate disposition:** `RETURN_R1_TIMING_START_NOT_CAPTURED` remains the correct Executor result because the Gate required a round-start marker before initial fetch. Reviewer does not convert that Gate to PASS; the missing exact start is retained as a process-observability defect.
- **Replay:** NONE. The timing defect cannot be repaired by replay and does not invalidate the already-completed document reconciliation.
- **Current-main drift check:** current main may advance for unrelated projects; Reviewer verified the post-`dd8651...` advancement touched only `birthday-magazine-studio/`, not this VPN project.
- **C2B source identity:** direct GitHub read-back confirms runner blob `cd5a2eb768b54d13307b651ea514a912b9742c9d` and template blob `b50f9747157200670d6e85fdd53ba81e9a8c5c76`.
- **Local worktree:** Executor reported the managed VPN worktree clean after durable read-back and cleanup; the next Gate must independently re-prove project-scoped cleanliness before the Owner checkpoint.
- **No live action occurred in R1.**
- **C2B R2R1 Executor preflight:** Owner-relayed Executor report states canonical/main, Gate alignment, project cleanliness, and locked runner/template identities passed; the current Codex execution shell failed the Owner-runtime boundary at PowerShell 7.6.5 / non-admin / medium integrity. Runner did not start.
- **Execution-channel disposition:** Codex runtime is not authorized to bypass that mismatch. Reviewer approves a one-shot Owner-local checkpoint only; this does not change the default execution channel.
- **Owner-local R2R1-O1 result:** Owner-reported output shows the real PowerShell 7.6.6/Admin runner started, passed Clash profile-store baseline, then failed read-only `PRECHECK_NETWORK_STATE` with `PropertyNotFoundException`; cleanup passed and no UI acknowledgement occurred.
- **Failure classification:** this is treated as runner/evidence-shape incompatibility until a read-only object-shape diagnostic identifies the missing property; it is not evidence of network drift.
- **D1 local-path result:** Owner reported `Test-Path` for the reviewed diagnostic in the existing Codex worktree returned `False`. Canonical GitHub contains the diagnostic, so the local worktree is stale rather than the diagnostic being absent from canonical.
- **D1R1 root result:** Owner-reported bounded checkpoint returned `WORKTREE_ROOT_MISMATCH` before fetch/sync/diagnostic. No C2B runner or network action occurred. Reviewer classifies the fault as an incorrect hardcoded Git-root assumption in the checkpoint, not local repository drift.
- **D1R2 path-encoding result:** Owner-reported Git top-level rendered the Chinese path component `VPS搭建` as mojibake `VPS鎼缓`; the checkpoint then compared that decoded string with the correct .NET Unicode runner path and returned `RUNNER_OUTSIDE_GIT_ROOT`. No fetch/update/diagnostic/C2B/network action occurred. This is a native-output path-decoding defect, not repository topology evidence.
- **D1R3 diagnostic result:** Owner-local evidence proved safe ff-only synchronization from `d87fbdd...` to `867604f...`, exact diagnostic blob identity, PowerShell 7.6.6/Admin/High integrity, and a successful read-only object-shape capture with no network mutation or Secret output.
- **Confirmed root cause:** all 23 ActiveStore IPv4 route objects exposed `DestinationPrefix`, `NextHop`, `InterfaceIndex`, and `RouteMetric`, while `PolicyStore` was absent on 23/23 objects. The original runner's `$_.PolicyStore` access therefore caused the `PropertyNotFoundException`.
- **Route-snapshot repair:** Owner-local validation passed all offline fixtures, including the new ActiveStore/no-object-PolicyStore regression guard; the route-object compatibility repair is accepted.
- **C2B retry result:** the repaired runner progressed past the prior network-state failure and profile-store baseline, then failed at `CREATE_OWNER_RUNTIME` with `OWNER_ACL_INHERITANCE_ENABLED`. Cleanup passed; no UI acknowledgement, Secret output, real HY2/REALITY/VPS action, or network mutation occurred.
- **ACL failure classification:** the Owner-only runtime ACL invariant remains required. The current failure is treated as ACL application/read-back incompatibility, not permission relaxation.
- **D2 diagnostic result:** Owner-local D2 synchronized safely to current main, verified the diagnostic blob, then returned `MethodException` before either ACL method produced evidence; cleanup passed and C2B/network/Secret actions remained absent.
- **D2 root cause refinement:** the diagnostic invoked the .NET Framework-shaped static `[IO.Directory]::CreateDirectory(path, DirectorySecurity)` call. On the target PowerShell 7.6.6/.NET runtime that call shape is not bindable; modern .NET exposes equivalent ACL-at-create behavior through `System.IO.FileSystemAclExtensions.CreateDirectory(DirectorySecurity, path)`.
- **D2R1 result:** both modern create-with-ACL and create-then-`Set-Acl` independently proved `PROTECTED=True`, correct Owner, exactly one Owner rule, zero inherited/unauthorized rules, direct FullControl, child FullControl, cleanup PASS, no network mutation, and no Secret output. Reviewer selects create-with-ACL because it avoids a temporary inherited-permission window.
- **ACL repair candidate:** canonical runner now uses `FileSystemAclExtensions.CreateDirectory` for both Owner runtime directories and explicitly `SetOwner($script:ownerSid)`; validator requires both properties and rejects regression to the old Directory overload.
- **ACL repair target validation:** Owner-local validator passed all fixtures including the modern Owner ACL regression guard, but the repaired runner still returned `OWNER_ACL_INHERITANCE_ENABLED` at `CREATE_OWNER_RUNTIME` before UI. Cleanup passed and no network/Secret action occurred.
- **Current leading hypothesis:** the fixed runner only uses the new ACL creation path when `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vpn-network-optimization\runtime` does not already exist. If that exact project-owned root already exists from an earlier failed run, the runner only validates its ACL and will fail before creating a fresh child. D3 is read-only and proves or rejects that residue hypothesis before any repair.
- **Benchmark detour remains cancelled.**

```

### PREFLIGHT

1. Use the existing elevated PowerShell 7.6.6 Owner session.
2. Operate Git from the known C2B scripts directory; do not parse Git-emitted Chinese filesystem paths.
3. Require project scope clean; fetch origin/main; require local HEAD ancestor of origin/main; update only with ff-only.
4. Require post-sync project scope clean and exact diagnostic blob `de16f13f22bf2cfaa0b8c7987153401b523a6d49`.
5. Do not run or patch the C2B runner.

### REQUIRED_EVIDENCE

- Owner runtime pass;
- safe ff-only synchronization and post-sync clean;
- exact D3 diagnostic blob;
- `RUNTIME_ROOT_EXISTS`;
- `RUNTIME_ROOT_REPARSE_POINT`;
- child count and empty/non-empty state only;
- ACL protected flag, owner match, rule count, inherited-rule count, unauthorized-rule count, direct/child FullControl;
- `RUNTIME_ROOT_DIAGNOSTIC=PASS` or precise RETURN;
- `RUNTIME_ROOT_MUTATION=NONE`;
- `NETWORK_MUTATION=NONE`;
- `SECRET_VALUES_EMITTED=0`;
- complete timing.

### ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA

PASS_CANDIDATE requires a complete read-only state capture of the exact runtime root. If the root exists, is empty, non-reparse, and its ACL violates the accepted Owner-only invariant, that is sufficient to classify the current failure as stale project-owned ACL residue. No repair occurs in D3.

### ROLLBACK_STATUS_OR_PLAN

Read-only Gate; no rollback action should be necessary.

### OWNER_ONLY_ACTIONS

Run the Reviewer-supplied atomic D3 checkpoint and return its complete non-secret output.

### REVIEWER_TO_EXECUTOR_RELAY

Do not rerun or patch C2B. Wait for Owner D3 output; persist only bounded runtime-root state facts; STOP_AT_REVIEWER.

### EXECUTOR_TO_REVIEWER_RELAY

Return `PASS_CANDIDATE_G3C_C2B_RUNTIME_ROOT_RESIDUE_DIAGNOSTIC_D3` or precise `RETURN_*`; STOP_AT_REVIEWER.

## NEXT_STEP

Read back the exact persistent runtime-root state. If it is an empty stale root with the old inherited ACL, Reviewer can authorize the smallest project-owned ACL reconciliation without replaying C2B first.

## OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED

Run the D3 atomic PowerShell checkpoint supplied by Reviewer. Do not rerun C2B and do not manually delete or change the runtime folder.

## REVIEWER_TO_EXECUTOR_RELAY

Wait for D3 Owner output. No C2B retry or ACL repair until Reviewer accepts the runtime-root state.

## EXECUTOR_TO_REVIEWER_RELAY

Return PASS_CANDIDATE_G3C_C2B_RUNTIME_ROOT_RESIDUE_DIAGNOSTIC_D3 or precise RETURN; STOP.
